        "Question 1: Explain the differences between AI, ML, Deep Learning (DL), and Data\n",
        "Science (DS).\n",
        "\n",
        "->1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: The broadest field. AI is about creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Chatbots, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, speech recognition (like Siri, Alexa).\n",
        "\n",
        "Scope: AI is the umbrella concept → ML, DL, etc. are part of AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Machine Learning (ML)\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: A subset of AI where machines learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: Algorithms that find patterns and make predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Spam email detection, fraud detection, stock price prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Idea: Feed data → algorithm learns → makes predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Deep Learning (DL)\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks (inspired by the human brain) with many layers (“deep”).\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: Works best with very large datasets and high computational power.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Face recognition, natural language processing (like ChatGPT), autonomous driving.\n",
        "\n",
        "Difference from ML: Traditional ML needs manual feature engineering, while DL automatically extracts features from raw data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Data Science (DS)\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: A multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, domain knowledge, and data analysis to extract insights and make decisions from data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: What are the types of machine learning? Describe each with one\n",
        "real-world example.\n",
        "\n",
        "->1. Supervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a dataset that contains both inputs (features) and their correct outputs (labels). The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Predict outcomes for new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Spam Email Detection – A model is trained on emails labeled as “spam” or “not spam”. When a new email arrives, the model predicts if it’s spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: In unsupervised learning, the model is given only inputs (no labels). It tries to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Discover patterns or groupings within the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer Segmentation – E-commerce websites group customers into clusters (e.g., “bargain shoppers,” “loyal customers”) based on purchase behavior, without predefined labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: A mix of supervised and unsupervised learning. The model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Improve learning accuracy when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Medical Diagnosis – Only a few medical images are labeled by doctors (due to high cost and effort), but many unlabeled images exist. Semi-supervised models use both to detect diseases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: In RL, an agent learns by interacting with an environment. It receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize the cumulative reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: Learn the best sequence of actions to achieve a goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-Driving Cars – The car (agent) learns to drive safely by making decisions (accelerate, brake, turn) and receiving feedback (reward for avoiding accidents, penalty for collisions).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3: Define overfitting, underfitting, and the bias-variance tradeoff in machine\n",
        "learning\n",
        "\n",
        "->1. Overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Overfitting happens when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations instead of just the underlying pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: The model performs very well on training data but poorly on unseen test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A decision tree that keeps splitting until every training sample is perfectly classified but fails on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Underfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: The model performs poorly on both training and test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Using a straight line (linear regression) to model data that follows a curved (nonlinear) relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias: Error from making overly simplistic assumptions about the data. (High bias → underfitting.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance: Error from the model being too sensitive to small changes in the training data. (High variance → overfitting.)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4: What are outliers in a dataset, and list three common techniques for\n",
        "handling them.\n",
        "\n",
        "->1.Removal of Outliers\n",
        "\n",
        "Directly eliminate outlier values if they are due to errors or irrelevant to analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Removing negative ages in a dataset of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Transformation of Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Apply mathematical transformations (e.g., log, square root, or Box-Cox) to reduce the effect of extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.This compresses the scale and makes outliers less influential.\n",
        "\n",
        "Capping (Winsorization)\n",
        "\n",
        "Replace extreme values beyond a threshold with the nearest acceptable value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Capping all values above the 95th percentile to the 95th percentile value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 5: Explain the process of handling missing values and mention one\n",
        "imputation technique for numerical and one for categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "->Handling Missing Values\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing values occur when no data is stored for a variable in an observation. Handling them is crucial because they can affect the accuracy of analysis and machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps in handling missing values:\n",
        "\n",
        "Identify missing data → Use methods like .isnull() or .info() in Python to detect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analyze the pattern → Check if data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), or Missing Not at Random (MNAR).\n",
        "\n",
        "Decide the strategy → Options include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Remove → Drop rows or columns with too many missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impute (fill in) → Replace missing values with estimated ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use models → Predict missing values using regression or machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imputation Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "Numerical Data → Mean Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean of the column.\n",
        "Example: If a \"Salary\" column has missing values, fill them with the average salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
